    <p><h2>Results Analysis helps to understand how students are learning, and how they have performed in each area of the programme. Result. analysis report can be used to identify areas of strength and weakness of a student. It also reveals the quality of teaching and the areas to be focused.
    <br><br>

<br>

4.Areas of Strength and Weakness: Identification of specific subjects or skills where students excel or struggle. This information guides educators in tailoring their teaching approaches to meet the unique needs of each student.<br>
